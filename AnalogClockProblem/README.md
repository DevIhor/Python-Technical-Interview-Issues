# Analog Clock Problem
You have an analog clock on the wall with hour hand and minute hand (you may forget about second hand).

So, the task is to write a Python function that calculates angle between hour hand and minute hand.

The input of the function is `time` object with current time.

The function should return a float number [0.0-180.0) - angle degrees.
